# Ads Pro

> An Unreal Engine plugin to display ads on mobile devices.

## Unreal Engine Marketplace
The plugin can be downloaded from the [Unreal Engine Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/003c2267b99c461d833b3664ee5552ee).

## How it works
The plugin uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob) of the target platform internally to display native ads. A simple yet complete API is available for both Blueprints
and C++ to seemlessly implement ads with Unreal Engine without bothering about platform-specific details.  
All functionalities are available without limitation for Blueprints and / or C++.

## Features
- Multiple Ad Formats.
- Ad Mediation.
- GDPR support.
- iOS 14 app transparency support.
- Really easy to use.
