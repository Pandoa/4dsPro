# Ads Pro

> An Unreal Engine plugin to display ads on mobile devices.

## Unreal Engine Marketplace
The plugin is still in development and is not available yet.  

## How it works
The plugin uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK of the target platform internally to display native ads. A simple yet complete API is disponible for both Blueprints
and C++ to seemlessly implement ads with Unreal Engine without bothering about platform-specific details.  
All functionalities are available without limitation for Blueprints and / or C++.

## Features
- Multiple Ad Formats.
- Ad Mediation.
- GDPR support.
- iOS 14 app transparency support.
